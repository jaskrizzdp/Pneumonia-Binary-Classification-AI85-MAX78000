# Pneumonia Binary Classification Using AI85/MAX78000

**Binary image classification of Healthy vs Pneumonia using the AI85 platform on MAX78000 microcontroller.**

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **binary classification system** that distinguishes between **Healthy** and **Pneumonia** chest X‑ray images. The model is trained and optimized using the **AI85 platform** and deployed on the **MAX78000** microcontroller for edge‑AI inference.  

This project demonstrates how a high‑performance AI model can be deployed on ultra‑low‑power embedded hardware to perform real‑time medical image classification.

## Key Features

- **Binary classification** of Healthy vs Pneumonia X‑ray images  
- **Optimized for AI85/MAX78000** edge‑AI acceleration  
- **Real‑time inference** on embedded device  
- **Efficient and low‑power** neural network deployment

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Chest X‑ray images are obtained from open-source datasets and labeled as Healthy or Pneumonia.  
2. **Model Training**: A binary classifier is trained to differentiate between the two classes.  
3. **AI85 Optimization**: The trained model is optimized for the AI85/MAX78000 inference engine.  
4. **Deployment (Ongoing)**: Deployment to the MAX78000 is in progress; edge inference will be available once finalized.  
5. **Inference**: The MAX78000 will process incoming images and output predictions at edge‑AI speeds once deployment is complete.
